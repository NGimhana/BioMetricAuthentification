>Biometric authentication is a security process that relies on the unique biological characteristics of an individual to verify that he is who is says he is. Biometric authentication systems compare a biometric data capture to stored, confirmed authentic data in a database. If both samples of the biometric data match, authentication is confirmed. Typically, biometric authentication is used to manage access to physical and digital resources such as buildings, rooms and computing devices.

## BioMetric Authentication Methods
- **Retinal scans** and iris scans can be used to authenticate users based on the unique patterns in their eyes
- **Voice analysis** may be easier for customers to use, especially over the telephone, but accuracy may not be as high as other methods.
- Body part geometry, including **finger geometry** and **earlobe geometry**, have been proposed for authenticating people but these methods may also be more easily spoofed
- **DNA matching** may be the most accurate and least subject to spoofing, but it may also be the most intrusive method for authenticating users.

This is a project which implements **Typing-DNA** Bio Metric Authentication Method.
